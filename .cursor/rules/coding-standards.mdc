# Coding Standards

## Naming Conventions

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use `PascalCase` for classes/modules
- Use descriptive names that reflect purpose

## Print Statements

- Avoid square brackets in print statements (the server uses them)

## Exports and Global Variables

- When using exports, search for a global variable with the same name and use it instead
- If a resource is being used more than twice, create a global variable for it
